PROJECT SUMMARY:
The goal of the project is to design and develop a chatbot for the Brock University and Canada Summer games webpages. This chatbot will aid visitors by allowing them to ask for information about events, dates, or any other questions that they may have. Visitors will be able to interact with the chatbot through a messaging system as if they were talking to a person in real time. The chatbot will be able to recognize requests and deliver useful information regarding the users queries.
