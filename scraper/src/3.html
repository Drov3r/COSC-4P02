<p>Add in five more years as Director of Culture and Recreation for the City of Hamilton, six years in Welland as both the Director of Parks &amp; Recreation and Director of Integrated Services. It&rsquo;s easy to see why Fenwick was a natural choice to be the Chair of the Games Services Committee for the Niagara 2022 Canada Summer Games.</p>
